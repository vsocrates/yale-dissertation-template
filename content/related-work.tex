\section{Large Language Model Calibration}

\subsection{Calibration in the General Domain}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss how calibration has been analyzed in neural networks for some time (focusing on text-forward models like LSTMs and transformers)
    \item Calibration in LLMs seems to be pretty good, especially in larger models
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Calibration in the Clinical Domain}
